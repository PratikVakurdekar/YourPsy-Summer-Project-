        <h1>Romantic Relationships</h1> <br>
        <br><h3>Advocate strengths</h3><br>
<p>When it comes to romantic relationships, Advocates take the process of finding a partner seriously. Not ones for casual encounters, people with the Advocate personality type instead look for depth and meaning in their relationships.
 </p>         
<p>Advocates will take the time necessary to find someone with whom they truly connect. Once they’ve found that someone, their relationships will reach a level of depth and sincerity of which most people can only dream.
</p> 
<p>Getting to that point can sometimes be a challenge for potential partners, especially if they are impatient types, as Advocates are often perfectionistic and picky. People with this personality type aren’t easily talked into something they don’t want. If someone doesn’t pick up on that, they are unlikely to be forgiven, particularly in the early stages of dating.
</p>
<p>Even worse is if their partner tries to resort to manipulation or lying, as Advocates will see right through it. If there’s anything they have a poor tolerance for in a relationship, it is a lack of authenticity.
</p>
<br><h3>Is This for Real</h3><br>
<p>Advocates will go out of their way to seek out people who share their desire for authenticity, and out of their way to avoid those who don’t, especially when looking for a partner. All that being said, people with the Advocate personality type often have the advantage of desirability. They are warm, friendly, caring, and insightful, seeing past facades and the obvious to understand others’ thoughts and emotions.
</p>
		 
<p>Advocate personalities are enthusiastic in their relationships. There is a sense of wisdom behind their spontaneity, allowing them to pleasantly surprise their partners again and again. These types aren’t afraid to show their love, and they feel it unconditionally.
</p>
<p>Advocates create a depth to their relationships that can hardly be described in conventional terms. Relationships with Advocates are not for the uncommitted or the shallow.
</p>		 

<p>When it comes to intimacy, Advocates look for a connection that goes beyond the physical. They prefer to embrace the emotional and even spiritual connection they have with their partners. People with this personality type are passionate partners.
 </p>
<p>Advocates see intimacy as a way to express their love and to make their partners happy. They cherish not just the act of being in a relationship, but what it means to become one with another person in mind, body, and soul.
