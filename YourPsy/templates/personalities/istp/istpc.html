<h1>    Career Paths </h1> 

<p>The Virtuoso personality type is probably the hardest to pin down in many aspects of life, but especially in their careers. Virtuosos thrive on diversity and unpredictability, on wondering “what’s next?” every morning. This makes Virtuosos one of the most mysterious personality types, but also one of the most versatile in the professional world.</p>

 <p>Virtuosos are born problem-solvers with an unwavering focus on practical solutions (though perhaps not always solutions to practical problems). No other type is quite as fascinated by how things work, how tools can be used, and how facts can be put together to create immediate and satisfying results. This combination of curiosity and hands-on vigor make people with the Virtuoso personality type excellent mechanics, engineers, graphic designers, and forensic scientists.</p>

 <p>“Practical” is the word of the day. But it’s not the practicality of routine administration that Virtuosos crave – they need variety and action, perhaps even a little adrenaline in their work. Highly structured environments leave Virtuoso personalities bored and tired. Jobs that focus on crisis response, such as firefighters, paramedics, detectives, pilots and police officers seem made for Virtuosos.</p>

 <p>Perhaps most important to Virtuosos though, is the feeling that they aren’t stuck. The freedom to wander, the freedom to declare their own schedules, their own responsibilities, their own environments – nearly every other consideration pales by comparison to the need to avoid inflexible commitments and stodgy colleagues. While this can be a significant hurdle to overcome in traditional employment, it is the chiefest allure of entrepreneurship.</p> 

<h2>Do Whatever Makes Your Heart Sing</h2> 

<p>Nearly any creative or constructive skill or interest can be offered on a freelance basis or on a business-owner’s own terms, be it blogger, systems analyst, athlete or driver. Virtuosos need to face down their weak long-term planning abilities and preference for instant results in order to make this path work, but livelihoods can be made selling bits and crafts in their free time. It’s also possible to find more traditional work to satisfy these needs, and forest ranger is a sought-after line of work for many Virtuosos.</p> 

<p>Virtuosos have a natural skill with troubleshooting, a relaxed, self-confident nature and a results-oriented focus. People with this personality type understand that risk equals reward, and as long as they can use that understanding with maturity, rather than just kicking the ant’s nest whenever they get bored, they are highly desirable in any dynamic field or environment.</p> <br>

 <b>Computer Hardware Engineer</b><br>
<p>ISTPs not only enjoy using computers as a problem-solving tool, but they also find inspiration in servicing computer hardware itself. The job description of a computer hardware engineer involves researching, designing, developing, and testing computer components and systems. These may include routers, circuit boards, memory devices, and processors. An individual in this role is expected to facilitate advances in computer technology through critical-thinking and engineering, playing to an ISTP’s strengths. </p><br>
<b> Chemical Plant Operator</b><br>
<p>The highly detail-oriented, black and white nature of this role makes it very appealing to the Myers-Briggs ISTP personality type. Chemical plant operators are required to adhere to very specific <p>inspection, operation, and safety regulations within a chemical manufacturing facility. They ensure that equipment is functioning correctly and that working conditions are safe at all times, with no room for leeway and no margin of error. </p><br>
<b> Electrical Technician</b><br>
<p>Another excellent career fit for the ISTP is that of an electrical technician. This job consists of building, calibrating, troubleshooting, and repairing electrical instruments and equipment. An electrical technician will spend their time visiting construction sites, inspecting machinery and structures, identifying technical discrepancies, and developing analytical, real-life solutions to fix any perceptible issues. ISTPs will find compatibility with the empirical, systematic nature of this role. </p><br>
<b>Agricultural Inspector</b><br>
<p>Agricultural inspectors are responsible for ensuring livestock and other natural resources are treated, stored, and utilized correctly. This includes on-site inspections of facility, machinery, and physical resources such as beef, fish, poultry, fertilizer, and grains. An agricultural inspector is required to stay abreast of all current government regulations relating to facilities practices and may be authorized to shut down any non-compliant facility. </p><br>
<b> Automotive Mechanic</b><br>
<p>Another career fit for ISTPs is the job of an automotive mechanic. This position entails the inspection, maintenance, and repair of cars and light trucks. Automotive mechanics are experts in the inner workings of vehicles, especially engines and undercarriage. The role requires a full knowledge base of car parts and electrical systems, as well as detail-oriented and thorough work ethic. </p>
<b> Mechanical Engineer</b><br>
<p>Mechanical engineering is one of the broadest engineering spheres, making it ideal for ISTPs just getting started in the industry. A mechanical engineer’s job description includes analyzing mechanical and thermal devices, troubleshooting problems, determining solutions, and completing repairs. They also develop and test prototypes of new, mechanical designs and devices. They may work on machinery such as elevators, escalators, automated transfer stations, and conveyor systems. </p><br>
<b>Avionics Technician</b><br>
<p>For ISTPs interested in airplanes and aerodynamic related machinery, the position of avionics technician may be a perfect fit. These individuals’ job is to assemble, install, maintain, and repair aircraft equipment. An avionics technician may work on interior fixtures such as navigation, radar systems, radios, and engines, or larger external components such as body and wings. </p><br>
<b> Construction or Building Inspector</b><br>
<p>A construction & building inspector is responsible for ensuring structures adhere to local and national zoning regulations, building codes, and contract specifications. This job involves reviewing plans, inspecting buildings, monitoring construction, surveying instruments, and verifying that safety regulations are being met. This is an ideal job for ISTPs as it requires a detail-minded and analytical individual. </p><br>
<b>Civil Engineer</b><br>
<p>For Myers-Briggs ISTPs interested in the general building and construction field, civil engineering may be the ideal career. Civil engineers spend their time on all kinds of construction projects—designing, assisting with building, and supervising construction workers. They may work in the public or private sector and may be contracted on buildings, bridges, airports, tunnels, and roads. This job is very numbers-heavy and may require managerial capabilities as well. </p><br>
