<h1>Career Paths</h1>
<p>Because Consuls’ traits are so strongly expressed, leading with practical sense and social vigor, the careers they find most satisfying usually revolve around making the best use of these qualities. Consuls are well-organized, enjoying bringing order and structure to their workplaces, and often work best in environments with clear, predictable hierarchies and tasks. Monotony and routine work are not a challenge for the Consul personality type, as they are happy to do what needs to be done.</p>
<br><h3>Cooperation, not Conflict</h3>
<p>Careers as administrators are a natural fit, allowing Consuls to organize not just an environment, but the people in it. Their practical skills combine well with their dependability, making Consul personalities surprisingly good accountants – though they often prefer to be personal accountants, helping people and interacting with them directly, instead of corporate accountants crunching numbers in some back room.</p>
 
<p>Purely analytical careers are often too dull for Consuls though – they need human interaction and emotional feedback to be truly satisfied in their line of work. Good listeners and enthusiastic team members, people with the Consul personality type are excellent providers of medical care and social work. Teaching is another great option, as Consuls are comfortable with authority, but are supportive and friendly enough to keep that authority from feeling overbearing.</p>
<p>Being as altruistic as they are, Consuls find it hard to be satisfied unless they know they’ve done something valuable for another person. This is often the driving force behind Consuls’ careers and career advancement, and makes religious work and counseling particularly rewarding.</p>
<p>Whatever they choose to do, Consul personalities’ comfort with busy social situations and practical knowledge and skills come together to create people who are not just able to be productive and helpful, but people who genuinely enjoy it.</p>
<b>Corporate Trainer</b>
<p>The ESFJ’s love for day-to-day operations and tasks makes them highly effective at this role. A corporate trainer has to make employees care about the little details. The responsibilities of a corporate trainer include developing easily digestible learning materials for the employees, creating training manuals, reporting to management and vendors and trainers, and motivating the company staff. </p>
<b>Optometrist</b>
<p>Optometrists are process-oriented. ESFJs don’t skip steps, which is why this personality type is a natural fit for optometry. This occupation requires optometrists to perform vision tests and analyze the results, diagnose eye problems, provide treatments, prescribe glasses, contact lenses, and medications, and promote eye health among their patients. </p>

<b>Special Education Teacher</b>
<p>Special education teachers assess students’ skills to determine their needs, develop teaching plans and Individualized Education Programs for each student, teach students individually and as a class, and communicate student progress with counselors, administrators, and parents. </p>
<b>Nurse</b>
<p>An ESFJ’s by-the-book mentality is precisely what makes them great for the medical field. People’s lives depend on them following procedure. Nurses record patient medical history and symptoms, observe patients and record observations, administer treatments and medicine, coordinate with doctors, use medical equipment, and help perform diagnostic tests on patients. </p>
<b>Dietitian</b>
<p>Dietitians want the best for people, which is a characteristic of the ESFJ personality type. In this occupation, you’ll be expected to provide health advice, plan diets, establish key health needs, encourage dietary changes, and support others in health and nutrition. </p>
<b>Real Estate Agent</b>
<p>Real estate agents have to be gregarious by nature. The good news for ESFJs is that their keen awareness in social situations allows them to adapt to satisfy potential clients from all angles. Real estate agents rent, sell, and buy properties, promote and advertise properties, create lists of properties for sale, and advise clients on all information regarding the real estate market. They also mediate negotiations between buyers and sellers and ensure contractual obligations are met. </p>
<b>Office Manager</b>
<p>This is about as ESFJ as any occupation gets. ESFJ’s seek to create a harmonious workplace. What better way to do that than to actually manage the office? Office managers organize meetings, arrange appointments, monitor the work of the administrative staff, manage office budgets, keep personnel records, organize onboarding programs for new hires, delegate tasks to junior employees, and serve as the liaison for staff, suppliers, and clients. </p>
<b>Advertising Sales Agent</b>
<p>It is an advertising sales agent job to locate and contact potential clients to offer ad services, explain to clients how specific adverts will help promote their products or services, provide estimates, prepare and deliver sales presentations, and process paperwork for all accounts. They also deliver proofs for approval, develop promo plans, and recommend sizes and formats for ads. </p>
<b>Receptionist</b>
<p>The receptionist is often the first face people see when they step into an office. They are the first impression of a company, which is exactly why the socially savvy ESFJ is the one for this job. Receptionists answer, screen, and forward phone calls, greet visitors and customers and escort them through the office, monitor who comes and goes, process travel vouchers or other documents, copy, file, and maintain records and documents, and perform administrative service tasks. </p>


<b>Buyer</b>
<p>Another job dealing with customers and negotiations. Once again, an ESFJ is an ideal fit for this career path. Buyers find suppliers, negotiate prices, pitch ideas to senior management, react to changes in customer demand, select new products while reviewing the old, maintain relationships with existing suppliers while also seeking new ones, gather feedback from customers, and attend trade events. </p>
